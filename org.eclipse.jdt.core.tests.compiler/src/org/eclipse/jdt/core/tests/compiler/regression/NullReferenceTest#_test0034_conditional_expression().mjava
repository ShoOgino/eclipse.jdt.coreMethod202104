// null analysis -- conditional expression
// TODO (maxime) fix - may consider simultaneous computation of expression null status
// this case is one of those which raise the need for the simultaneous calculation of
// the null status of an expression and the code analysis of the said expression; this
// case is simplistic: we need a value (here, potentially null), that is *not* carried
// by the current embodiment of the flow info; other cases are less trivial in which
// side effects on variables could introduce errors into after the facts evaluations;
// one possible trick would be to add a slot for this
// other path: use a tainted unknown expression status; does not seem to cope well 
// with o = (o ==  null ? new Object() : o)
