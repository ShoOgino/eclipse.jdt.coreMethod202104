/**
 * From JLS 13 16.1.7 , Suppose that the switch expression has result expressions e1, â€¦, en, all of
 * which are boolean-valued. 
 * The following rules apply only if the switch block of a switch expression consists of switch labeled rules:
 * V is definitely assigned after a switch expression when true iff for every switch labeled rule one of the following is true:
 * 		It is a switch labeled expression e and V is definitely assigned after e when true.
 * 		It is a switch labeled block b and for every value yield statement expression e contained in b that may exit the switch expression, 
 * 			V is definitely assigned after e when true.
 * 		It is a switch labeled throw statement.
 * 
 * V is definitely assigned after a switch expression when false iff for every switch labeled rule one of the following is true:
 * 		It is a switch labeled expression e and V is definitely assigned after e when false.
 * 		It is a switch labeled block b and for every value yield statement expression e contained in b that may exit the switch expression,
 * 		V is definitely assigned after e when false.
 * 		It is a switch labeled throw statement.
