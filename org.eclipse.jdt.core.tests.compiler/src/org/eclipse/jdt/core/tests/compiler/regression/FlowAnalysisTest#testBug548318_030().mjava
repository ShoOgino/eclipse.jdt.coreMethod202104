/**
 * From JLS 13 16.2.9, [tests the second rule - unassigned]
 * V is [un]assigned after a switch statement (14.11) iff all of the following are true:
 *     V is [un]assigned before every break statement that may exit the switch statement.
 *     For each switch labeled rule (14.11.1) in the switch block, V is [un]assigned after the
 *         expression, block, or throw statement of the switch labeled rule.
 *     If there is a switch labeled statement group (14.11.1) in the switch block, then V is [un]assigned
 *         after the last block statement of the last switch labeled statement group.
 *     If there is no default label in the switch block, or if the switch block ends with a switch label
 *        followed by }, then V is [un]assigned after the selector expression
