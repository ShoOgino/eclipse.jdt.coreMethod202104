	 * Returns the fully qualified name of this type,

	 * This is the name of the package, followed by <code>'.'</code>,
	 * followed by the type-qualified name using the <code>enclosingTypeSeparator</code>.
	 * 
	 * For example:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>the fully qualified name of a class B defined as a member of a class A in a compilation unit A.java 
	 *     in a package x.y using the '.' separator is "x.y.A.B"</li>
	 * <li>the fully qualified name of a class B defined as a member of a class A in a compilation unit A.java 
	 *     in a package x.y using the '$' separator is "x.y.A$B"</li>
	 * <li>the fully qualified name of a binary type whose class file is x/y/A$B.class
	 *     using the '.' separator is "x.y.A.B"</li>
	 * <li>the fully qualified name of a binary type whose class file is x/y/A$B.class
	 *     using the '$' separator is "x.y.A$B"</li>
	 * <li>the fully qualified name of an anonymous binary type whose class file is x/y/A$1.class
	 *     using the '.' separator is "x.y.A.1"</li>
	 * </ul>
