/**
 * Reconciles the contents of this working copy, sends out a Java delta
 * notification indicating the nature of the change of the working copy since
 * the last time it was either reconciled or made consistent
 * ({@link IOpenable#makeConsistent(IProgressMonitor)}), and returns a
 * compilation unit AST if requested.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the problem detection is forced by passing the {@link #FORCE_PROBLEM_DETECTION} bit in the given reconcile flag,
 * problem detection is run even if the working copy is already consistent.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It performs the reconciliation by locally caching the contents of
 * the working copy, updating the contents, then creating a delta
 * over the cached contents and the new contents, and finally firing
 * this delta.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This functionality allows to specify a working copy owner which is used
 * during problem detection. All references contained in the working copy are
 * resolved against other units; for which corresponding owned working copies
 * are going to take precedence over their original compilation units. If
 * <code>null</code> is passed in, then the primary working copy owner is used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Compilation problems found in the new contents are notified through the
 * {@link IProblemRequestor} interface which was passed at
 * creation, and no longer as transient markers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: Since 3.0, added/removed/changed inner types generate change deltas.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If requested, a DOM AST representing the compilation unit is returned.
 * Its bindings are computed only if the problem requestor is active, or if the
 * problem detection is forced. This method returns <code>null</code> if the
 * creation of the DOM AST was not requested, or if the requested level of AST
 * API is not supported, or if the working copy was already consistent.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If statements recovery is enabled by passing the {@link #ENABLE_STATEMENTS_RECOVERY} bit in the given reconcile flag
 * then this method tries to rebuild statements with syntax error. Otherwise statements with syntax error won't be
 * present in the returning DOM AST.</p>
 * <p>
 * If bindings recovery is enabled by passing the {@link #ENABLE_BINDINGS_RECOVERY} bit in the given reconcile flag
 * then this method tries to resolve bindings even if the type resolution contains errors.</p>
 * <p>
 * The given reconcile flags is a bit-mask of the different constants ({@link #ENABLE_BINDINGS_RECOVERY},
 * {@link #ENABLE_STATEMENTS_RECOVERY}, {@link #FORCE_PROBLEM_DETECTION}). Unspecified values are left for future use.
 * </p>
