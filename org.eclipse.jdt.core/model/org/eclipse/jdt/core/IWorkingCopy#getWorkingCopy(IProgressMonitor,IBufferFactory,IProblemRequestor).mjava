	 * Note that this factory will be used for the life time of this working copy, that is if the 
	 * working copy is closed then reopened, this factory will be reused.
	 * The buffer will be automatically initialized with the original's compilation unit content
	 * upon creation.
	 * <p>
	 * Note: if intending to share a working copy amongst several clients, then 
	 * <code>#getSharedWorkingCopy</code> should be used instead.
	 * </p><p>
	 * When the working copy instance is created, an ADDED IJavaElementDelta is 
	 * reported on this working copy.
	 * </p><p>
	 * Since 2.1, a working copy can be created on a not-yet existing compilation
	 * unit. In particular, such a working copy can then be committed in order to create
	 * the corresponding compilation unit.
	 * </p>
	 * @param monitor a progress monitor used to report progress while opening this compilation unit
	 *                 or <code>null</code> if no progress should be reported 
	 * @param factory the factory that creates a buffer that is used to get the content of the working copy
	 *                 or <code>null</code> if the internal factory should be used
	 * @param problemRequestor a requestor which will get notified of problems detected during
	 * 	reconciling as they are discovered. The requestor can be set to <code>null</code> indicating
	 * 	that the client is not interested in problems.
