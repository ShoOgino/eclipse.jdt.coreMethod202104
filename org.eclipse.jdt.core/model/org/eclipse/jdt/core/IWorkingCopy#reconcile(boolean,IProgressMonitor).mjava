	/**
	 * Reconciles the contents of this working copy.
	 * It performs the reconciliation by locally caching the contents of 
	 * the working copy, updating the contents, then creating a delta 
	 * over the cached contents and the new contents, and finally firing
	 * this delta.
	 * <p>
	 * The boolean argument allows to force problem detection even if the
	 * working copy is already consistent.</p>
	 * <p>
	 * Compilation problems found in the new contents are notified through the
	 * <code>IProblemRequestor</code> interface which was passed at
	 * creation, and no longer as transient markers. Therefore this API answers
	 * nothing.</p>
	 * <p>
 	 * Note: Since 3.0 added/removed/changed inner types generate change deltas.</p>
	 *
	 * @param forceProblemDetection boolean indicating whether problem should be recomputed
	 *   even if the source hasn't changed.
	 * @param monitor a progress monitor
	 * @exception JavaModelException if the contents of the original element
	 *		cannot be accessed. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> The original Java element does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * @since 2.0
	 * 
	 * @deprecated Use {@link ICompilationUnit#reconcile(int, boolean, WorkingCopyOwner, IProgressMonitor)} instead.
