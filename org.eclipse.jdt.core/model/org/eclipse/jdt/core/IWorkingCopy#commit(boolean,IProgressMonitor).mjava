	/**
	 * Commits the contents of this working copy to its original element
	 * and underlying resource, bringing the Java model up-to-date with
	 * the current contents of the working copy.
	 *
	 * <p>It is possible that the contents of the original resource have changed
	 * since this working copy was created, in which case there is an update conflict.
	 * The value of the <code>force</code> parameter effects the resolution of
	 * such a conflict:<ul>
	 * <li> <code>true</code> - in this case the contents of this working copy are applied to
	 * 	the underlying resource even though this working copy was created before
	 *	a subsequent change in the resource</li>
	 * <li> <code>false</code> - in this case a <code>JavaModelException</code> is thrown</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * Since 2.1, a working copy can be created on a not-yet existing compilation
	 * unit. In particular, such a working copy can then be committed in order to create
	 * the corresponding compilation unit.
	 * </p>
	 * @param force a flag to handle the cases when the contents of the original resource have changed
	 * since this working copy was created
	 * @param monitor the given progress monitor
	 * @exception JavaModelException if this working copy could not commit. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> A <code>CoreException</code> occurred while updating an underlying resource
	 * <li> This element is not a working copy (INVALID_ELEMENT_TYPES)
	 * <li> A update conflict (described above) (UPDATE_CONFLICT)
	 * </ul>
	 * @deprecated Use {@link ICompilationUnit#commitWorkingCopy(boolean, IProgressMonitor)} instead.
