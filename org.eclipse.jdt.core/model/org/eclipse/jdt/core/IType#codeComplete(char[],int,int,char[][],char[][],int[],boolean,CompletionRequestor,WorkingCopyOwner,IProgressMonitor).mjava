	 * Do code completion inside a code snippet in the context of the current type.
	 * It considers types in the working copies with the given owner first. In other words,
	 * the owner's working copies will take precedence over their original compilation units
	 * in the workspace.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that if a working copy is empty, it will be as if the original compilation
	 * unit had been deleted.
	 * </p><p>
	 * If the type has access to its source code and the insertion position is valid,
	 * then completion is performed against the source. Otherwise the completion is performed
	 * against the type structure and the given locals variables.

	 * If {@link IProgressMonitor} is not <code>null</code> then some proposals which
	 * can be very long to compute are proposed. To avoid that the code assist operation
	 * take too much time a {@link IProgressMonitor} which automatically cancel the code
	 * assist operation when a specified amount of time is reached could be used.
