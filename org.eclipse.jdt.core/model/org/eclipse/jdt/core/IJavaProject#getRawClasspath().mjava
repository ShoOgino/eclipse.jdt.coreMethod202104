	/**
	 * Returns the raw classpath for the project, as a list of classpath
	 * entries. This corresponds to the exact set of entries which were assigned
	 * using <code>setRawClasspath</code>, in particular such a classpath may
	 * contain classpath variable and classpath container entries. Classpath
	 * variable and classpath container entries can be resolved using the
	 * helper method <code>getResolvedClasspath</code>; classpath variable
	 * entries also can be resolved individually using 
	 * <code>JavaCore#getClasspathVariable</code>). 
	 * <p>
	 * Both classpath containers and classpath variables provides a level of
	 * indirection that can make the <code>.classpath</code> file stable across
	 * workspaces.
	 * As an example, classpath variables allow a classpath to no longer refer
	 * directly to external JARs located in some user specific location.
	 * The classpath can simply refer to some variables defining the proper
	 * locations of these external JARs. Similarly, classpath containers
	 * allows classpath entries to be computed dynamically by the plug-in that
	 * defines that kind of classpath container.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note that in case the project isn't yet opened, the classpath will
	 * be read directly from the associated <tt>.classpath</tt> file.
