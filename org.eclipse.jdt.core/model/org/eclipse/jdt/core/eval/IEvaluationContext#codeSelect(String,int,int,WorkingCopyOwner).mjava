	 * Note that if a working copy is empty, it will be as if the original compilation
	 * unit had been deleted.

	 * @param offset the position in the code snippet of the first character
	 *   of the code to resolve
	 * @param length the length of the selected code to resolve
	 * @param owner the owner of working copies that take precedence over their original compilation units
	 * @return the (possibly empty) list of selection Java elements
	 * @exception JavaModelException if code resolve could not be performed.
