	/**
	 * Evaluates the given code snippet in the context of a suspended thread.
	 * The code snippet is compiled along with this context's package declaration,
	 * imports, and global variables. The given requestor's
	 * <code>acceptProblem</code> method is called for each compilation problem that
	 * is detected. Then the resulting class files are handed to the given
	 * requestor's <code>acceptClassFiles</code> method to deploy and run.
	 * <p>
	 * The requestor is expected to:
	 * <ol>
	 *   <li>send the class files to the target VM,
	 *   <li>load them (starting with the code snippet class),
	 *   <li>create a new instance of the code snippet class,
	 *   <li>run the method <code>run()</code> of the code snippet,
	 *   <li>retrieve the values of the local variables,
	 *   <li>retrieve the returned value of the code snippet
	 * </ol>
	 * <p>
	 * This method is long-running; progress and cancellation are provided
	 * by the given progress monitor.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param codeSnippet the code snippet
	 * @param localVariableTypeNames the dot-separated fully qualified names of the types of the local variables.
	 * @param localVariableNames the names of the local variables as they are declared in the user's code.
	 * @param localVariableModifiers the modifiers of the local variables (default modifier or final modifier).
	 * @param declaringType the type in which the code snippet is evaluated.
	 * @param isStatic whether the code snippet is evaluated in a static member of the declaring type.
	 * @param isConstructorCall whether the code snippet is evaluated in a constructor of the declaring type.
	 * @param requestor the code snippet requestor
	 * @param progressMonitor a progress monitor
	 * @exception JavaModelException if a runtime problem occurred or if this
	 *   context's project has no build state
