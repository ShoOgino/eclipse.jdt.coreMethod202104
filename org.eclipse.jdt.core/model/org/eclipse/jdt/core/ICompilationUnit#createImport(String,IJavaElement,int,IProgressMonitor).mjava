/**
 * Creates and returns an import declaration in this compilation unit
 * with the given name.
 * <p>
 * Optionally, the new element can be positioned before the specified
 * sibling. If no sibling is specified, the element will be inserted
 * as the last import declaration in this compilation unit.
 * <p>
 * If the compilation unit already includes the specified import declaration,
 * the import is not generated (it does not generate duplicates).
 * Note that it is valid to specify both a single-type import and an on-demand import
 * for the same package, for example <code>"java.io.File"</code> and
 * <code>"java.io.*"</code>, in which case both are preserved since the semantics
 * of this are not the same as just importing <code>"java.io.*"</code>.
 * Importing <code>"java.lang.*"</code>, or the package in which the compilation unit
 * is defined, are not treated as special cases.  If they are specified, they are
 * included in the result.
 * <p>
 * Note: Static imports are an experimental language feature 
 * under discussion in JSR-201 and under consideration for inclusion
 * in the 1.5 release of J2SE. The support here is therefore tentative
 * and subject to change.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param name the name of the import declaration to add as defined by JLS2 7.5. (For example: <code>"java.io.File"</code> or
 *  <code>"java.awt.*"</code>)
 * @param sibling the existing element which the import declaration will be inserted immediately before (if
 *	<code> null </code>, then this import will be inserted as the last import declaration.
 * @param flags <code>Flags.AccStatic</code> for static imports, or
 * <code>Flags.AccDefault</code> for regular imports; other modifier flags
 * are ignored
 * @param monitor the progress monitor to notify
 * @return the newly inserted import declaration (or the previously existing one in case attempting to create a duplicate)
 *
 * @throws JavaModelException if the element could not be created. Reasons include:
 * <ul>
 * <li> This Java element does not exist or the specified sibling does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
 * <li> A <code>CoreException</code> occurred while updating an underlying resource
 * <li> The specified sibling is not a child of this compilation unit (INVALID_SIBLING)
 * <li> The name is not a valid import name (INVALID_NAME)
 * </ul>
 * @see Flags
 * @since 3.0
