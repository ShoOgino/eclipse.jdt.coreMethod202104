/**
 * Triggers an update of the JavaModel with respect to the referenced external archives.
 * This operation will issue a JavaModel delta describing the discovered changes, in term
 * of Java element package fragment roots added, removed or changed.
 * Note that a collection of elements can be passed so as to narrow the set of archives
 * to refresh (passing <code>null</code> along is equivalent to refreshing the entire mode).
 * The elements can be:
 * <ul>
 * <li> package fragment roots corresponding to external archives
 * <li> Java projects, which referenced external archives will be refreshed
 * <li> Java model, all referenced external archives will be refreshed.
 * </ul>
 * <p> In case an archive is used by multiple projects, the delta issued will account for
 * all of them. This means that even if a project was not part of the elements scope, it
 * may still be notified of changes if it is referencing a library comprised in the scope.
 * <p>
 * <b>Since 3.7</b>, a project refresh automatically triggers a refresh of external archives.
 * Hence, this method doesn't need to be explicitly called after a project refresh.
 * <p>
 * @param elementsScope - a collection of elements defining the scope of the refresh
 * @param monitor - a progress monitor used to report progress
 * @exception JavaModelException in one of the corresponding situation:
 * <ul>
 *    <li> an exception occurs while accessing project resources </li>
 * </ul>
