/**
 * Changes this compilation unit handle into a working copy. A new {@link IBuffer} is
 * created using this compilation unit handle's owner. Uses the primary owner if none was
 * specified when this compilation unit handle was created.
 * <p>
 * When switching to working copy mode, problems are reported to given
 * {@link IProblemRequestor}. Note that once in working copy mode, the given
 * {@link IProblemRequestor} is ignored. Only the original {@link IProblemRequestor}
 * is used to report subsequent problems.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once in working copy mode, changes to this compilation unit or its children are done in memory.
 * Only the new buffer is affected. Using {@link #commitWorkingCopy(boolean, IProgressMonitor)}
 * will bring the underlying resource in sync with this compilation unit.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If this compilation unit was already in working copy mode, an internal counter is incremented and no
 * other action is taken on this compilation unit. To bring this compilation unit back into the original mode
 * (where it reflects the underlying resource), {@link #discardWorkingCopy} must be call as many
 * times as {@link #becomeWorkingCopy(IProblemRequestor, IProgressMonitor)}.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param problemRequestor a requestor which will get notified of problems detected during
 * 	reconciling as they are discovered. The requestor can be set to <code>null</code> indicating
 * 	that the client is not interested in problems.
 * @param monitor a progress monitor used to report progress while opening this compilation unit
 * 	or <code>null</code> if no progress should be reported
 * @throws JavaModelException if this compilation unit could not become a working copy.
 * @see #discardWorkingCopy()
 * @since 3.0
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@link #becomeWorkingCopy(IProgressMonitor)} instead.
 * 	Note that if this deprecated method is used, problems will be reported on the passed problem requester
 * 	as well as on the problem requestor returned by the working copy owner (if not null).
