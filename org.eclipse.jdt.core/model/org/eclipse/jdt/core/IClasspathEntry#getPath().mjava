	/**
	 * Returns the path of this classpath entry.
	 *
	 * The meaning of the path of a classpath entry depends on its entry kind:<ul>
	 *	<li>Source code in the current project ({@link #CPE_SOURCE}) -  
	 *      The path associated with this entry is the absolute path to the root folder. </li>
	 *	<li>A binary library in the current project ({@link #CPE_LIBRARY}) - the path
	 *		associated with this entry is the absolute path to the JAR (or root folder), and 
	 *		in case it refers to an external JAR, then there is no associated resource in 
	 *		the workbench.
	 *	<li>A required project ({@link #CPE_PROJECT}) - the path of the entry denotes the
	 *		path to the corresponding project resource.</li>
	 *  <li>A variable entry ({@link #CPE_VARIABLE}) - the first segment of the path 
	 *      is the name of a classpath variable. If this classpath variable
	 *		is bound to the path <i>P</i>, the path of the corresponding classpath entry
	 *		is computed by appending to <i>P</i> the segments of the returned
	 *		path without the variable.</li>
	 *  <li> A container entry ({@link #CPE_CONTAINER}) - the path of the entry
	 * 	is the name of the classpath container, which can be bound indirectly to a set of classpath 
	 * 	entries after resolution. The containerPath is a formed by a first ID segment followed with 
	 *     extra segments that can be used as additional hints for resolving this container 
	 * 	reference (also see {@link IClasspathContainer}).
	 * </li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * @return the path of this classpath entry
