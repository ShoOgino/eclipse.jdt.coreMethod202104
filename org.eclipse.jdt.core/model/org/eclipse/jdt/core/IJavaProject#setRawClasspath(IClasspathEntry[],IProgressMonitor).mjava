	/**
	 * Sets the classpath of this project using a list of classpath entries. In particular such a classpath may contain
	 * classpath variable entries. Classpath variable entries can be resolved individually ({@link JavaCore#getClasspathVariable(String)}),
	 * or the full classpath can be resolved at once using the helper method {@link #getResolvedClasspath(boolean)}.
	 * <p>
	 * A classpath variable provides an indirection level for better sharing a classpath. As an example, it allows
	 * a classpath to no longer refer directly to external JARs located in some user specific location. The classpath
	 * can simply refer to some variables defining the proper locations of these external JARs.
	 * <p>
	 * Setting the classpath to <code>null</code> specifies a default classpath
	 * (the project root). Setting the classpath to an empty array specifies an
	 * empty classpath.
	 * <p>
	 * If a cycle is detected while setting this classpath, an error marker will be added
	 * to the project closing the cycle.
	 * To avoid this problem, use {@link #hasClasspathCycle(IClasspathEntry[])}
	 * before setting the classpath.
	 * <p>
	 * This operation acquires a lock on the workspace's root.
	 *
	 * @param entries a list of classpath entries
	 * @param monitor the given progress monitor
	 * @exception JavaModelException if the classpath could not be set. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> This Java element does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
	 * <li> The classpath is being modified during resource change event notification (CORE_EXCEPTION)
	 * <li> The classpath failed the validation check as defined by {@link JavaConventions#validateClasspath(IJavaProject, IClasspathEntry[], IPath)}
	 * </ul>
	 * @see IClasspathEntry
