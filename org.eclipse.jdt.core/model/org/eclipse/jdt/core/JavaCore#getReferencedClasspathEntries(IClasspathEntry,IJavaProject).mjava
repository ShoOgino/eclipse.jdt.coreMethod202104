	 * Returns an array of classpath entries that are referenced directly or indirectly
	 * by a given classpath entry. For the entry kind {@link IClasspathEntry#CPE_LIBRARY},
	 * the method returns the libraries that are included in the Class-Path section of
	 * the MANIFEST.MF file. If a referenced JAR file has further references to other library
	 * entries, they are processed recursively and added to the list. For entry kinds other
	 * than {@link IClasspathEntry#CPE_LIBRARY}, this method returns an empty array.
	 * <p>
	 * When a non-null project is passed, any additional attributes that may have been stored
	 * previously in the project's .classpath file are retrieved and populated in the
	 * corresponding referenced entry. If the project is <code>null</code>, the raw referenced
	 * entries are returned without any persisted attributes.
	 * For more details on storing referenced entries, see
	 * {@link IJavaProject#setRawClasspath(IClasspathEntry[], IClasspathEntry[], IPath,
	 * IProgressMonitor)}.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param libraryEntry the library entry whose referenced entries are sought
	 * @param project project where the persisted referenced entries to be retrieved from. If <code>null</code>
	 * 			persisted attributes are not attempted to be retrieved.
	 * @return an array of classpath entries that are referenced directly or indirectly by the given entry.
	 * 			If not applicable, returns an empty array.
