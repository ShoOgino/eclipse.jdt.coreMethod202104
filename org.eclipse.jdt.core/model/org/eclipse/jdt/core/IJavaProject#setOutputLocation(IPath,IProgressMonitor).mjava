	 * <p>
	 * The default output location is where class files are ordinarily generated
	 * (and resource files, copied). Each source classpath entries can also
	 * specify an output location for the generated class files (and copied
	 * resource files) corresponding to compilation units under that source
	 * folder. This makes it possible to arrange that generated class files for
	 * different source folders to end up in different output folders, and not
	 * necessarily the default output folder. This means that the generated
	 * class files for the project may end up scattered across several folders,
	 * rather than all in the default output folder (which is more standard).
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param path the workspace-relative absolute path of the default output
	 * folder
	 * @param monitor the progress monitor
	 *

	 *  <li> This Java element does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
	 *  <li> The path refers to a location not contained in this project (<code>PATH_OUTSIDE_PROJECT</code>)
	 *  <li> The path is not an absolute path (<code>RELATIVE_PATH</code>)
	 *  <li> The path is nested inside a package fragment root of this project (<code>INVALID_PATH</code>)
