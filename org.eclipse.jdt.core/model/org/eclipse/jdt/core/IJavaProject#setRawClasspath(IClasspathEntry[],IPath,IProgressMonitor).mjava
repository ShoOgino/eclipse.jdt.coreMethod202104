	/**
	 * Sets the both the classpath of this project and its default output
	 * location at once. The classpath is defined using a list of classpath
	 * entries. In particular, such a classpath may contain classpath variable
	 * entries. Classpath variable entries can be resolved individually (see
	 * ({@link JavaCore#getClasspathVariable(String)}), or the full classpath can be
	 * resolved at once using the helper method
	 * {@link #getResolvedClasspath(boolean)}.
	 * <p>
	 * A classpath variable provides an indirection level for better sharing a
	 * classpath. As an example, it allows a classpath to no longer refer
	 * directly to external JARs located in some user specific location. The
	 * classpath can simply refer to some variables defining the proper
	 * locations of these external JARs.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Setting the classpath to <code>null</code> specifies a default classpath
	 * (the project root). Setting the classpath to an empty array specifies an
	 * empty classpath.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If a cycle is detected while setting this classpath, an error marker will
	 * be added to the project closing the cycle. To avoid this problem, use
	 * {@link #hasClasspathCycle(IClasspathEntry[])} before setting
	 * the classpath.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This operation acquires a lock on the workspace's root.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param entries a list of classpath entries
	 * @param monitor the progress monitor
	 * @param outputLocation the default output location
	 * @exception JavaModelException if the classpath could not be set. Reasons
	 * include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> This Java element does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
	 * <li> Two or more entries specify source roots with the same or overlapping paths (NAME_COLLISION)
	 * <li> A entry of kind <code>CPE_PROJECT</code> refers to this project (INVALID_PATH)
	 *  <li>This Java element does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
	 *	<li>The output location path refers to a location not contained in this project (<code>PATH_OUTSIDE_PROJECT</code>)
	 *	<li>The output location path is not an absolute path (<code>RELATIVE_PATH</code>)
	 *  <li>The output location path is nested inside a package fragment root of this project (<code>INVALID_PATH</code>)
	 * <li> The classpath is being modified during resource change event notification (CORE_EXCEPTION)
	 * </ul>
