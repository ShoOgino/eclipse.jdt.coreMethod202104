	/**
	 * Returns the raw classpath for the project as defined by its
	 * <code>.classpath</code> file from disk, or <code>null</code>
	 * if unable to read the file. 
	 * <p>
	 * This classpath may differ from the in-memory classpath returned by
	 * <code>getRawClasspath</code>, in case the automatic reconciliation
	 * mechanism has not been performed yet. Usually, any change to the
	 * <code>.classpath</code> file is automatically noticed and reconciled at
	 * the next resource change notification event. However, if the file is
	 * modified within an operation, where this change needs to be taken into
	 * account before the operation ends, then the classpath from disk can be
	 * read using this method, and further assigned to the project using
	 * <code>setRawClasspath(...)</code>. 
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Classpath variable and classpath container entries can be resolved using
	 * the helper method <code>getResolvedClasspath</code>; classpath variable
	 * entries also can be resolved individually using 
	 * <code>JavaCore#getClasspathVariable</code>).
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note that no check is performed whether the project has the Java nature
	 * set, allowing an existing <code>.classpath</code> file to be considered
	 * independantly (unlike <code>getRawClasspath</code> which requires the
	 * Java nature to be associated with the project). 
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * In order to manually force a project classpath refresh, one can simply
	 * assign the project classpath using the result of this method, as follows:
	 * <code>proj.setRawClasspath(proj.readRawClasspath(), proj.readOutputLocation(), monitor)</code>
	 * (note that the <code>readRawClasspath/readOutputLocation</code> methods
	 * could return <code>null</code>).
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @return the raw classpath from disk for the project, as a list of
	 * classpath entries
	 * @see #getRawClasspath()
	 * @see IClasspathEntry
	 * @since 3.0
