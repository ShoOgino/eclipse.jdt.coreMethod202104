/**
 * Reconciles the contents of this working copy.
 * It performs the reconciliation by locally caching the contents of 
 * the working copy, updating the contents, then creating a delta 
 * over the cached contents and the new contents, and finally firing
 * this delta.
 * <p>
 * If the working copy hasn't changed, then no problem will be detected,
 * this is equivalent to <code>IWorkingCopy#reconcile(false, null)</code>.
 * <p>
 * Compilation problems found in the new contents are notified through the
 * <code>IProblemRequestor</code> interface which was passed at
 * creation, and no longer as transient markers. Therefore this API will
 * return <code>null</code>.
 * <p>
 * Note: It has been assumed that added inner types should
 * not generate change deltas.  The implementation has been
 * modified to reflect this assumption.
 *
 * @exception JavaModelException if the contents of the original element
 *		cannot be accessed. Reasons include:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The original Java element does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
 * </ul>
 * @return <code>null</code>
