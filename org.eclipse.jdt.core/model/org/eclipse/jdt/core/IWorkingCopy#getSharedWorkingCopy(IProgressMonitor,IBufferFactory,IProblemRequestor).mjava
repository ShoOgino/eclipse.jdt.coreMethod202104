	/**
	 * Returns a shared working copy on this element using the given factory to create
	 * the buffer, or this element if this element is already a working copy.
	 * This API can only answer an already existing working copy if it is based on the same
	 * original compilation unit AND was using the same buffer factory (that is, as defined by <code>Object.equals</code>).	 
	 * <p>
	 * The life time of a shared working copy is as follows:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>The first call to <code>getSharedWorkingCopy(...)</code> creates a new working copy for this
	 *     element</li>
	 * <li>Subsequent calls increment an internal counter.</li>
	 * <li>A call to <code>destroy()</code> decrements the internal counter.</li>
	 * <li>When this counter is 0, the working copy is destroyed.
	 * </ul>
	 * So users of this method must destroy exactly once the working copy.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that the buffer factory will be used for the life time of this working copy, that is if the 
	 * working copy is closed then reopened, this factory will be used.
	 * The buffer will be automatically initialized with the original's compilation unit content
	 * upon creation.
	 * <p>
	 * When the shared working copy instance is created, an ADDED IJavaElementDelta is reported on this
	 * working copy.
	 *
	 * @param monitor a progress monitor used to report progress while opening this compilation unit
	 *                 or <code>null</code> if no progress should be reported 
	 * @param factory the factory that creates a buffer that is used to get the content of the working copy
	 *                 or <code>null</code> if the internal factory should be used
	 * @param problemRequestor a requestor which will get notified of problems detected during
	 * 	reconciling as they are discovered. The requestor can be set to <code>null</code> indicating
	 * 	that the client is not interested in problems.
	 * @exception JavaModelException if the contents of this element can
	 *   not be determined. 
	 * @return a shared working copy on this element using the given factory to create
	 * the buffer, or this element if this element is already a working copy
	 * @see IBufferFactory
	 * @see IProblemRequestor
	 * @since 2.0
	 * 
	 * @deprecated Use {@link ICompilationUnit#getWorkingCopy(WorkingCopyOwner, IProblemRequestor, IProgressMonitor)} instead.
