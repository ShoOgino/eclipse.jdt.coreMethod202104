	 * Request a registered container definition to be updated according to a container suggestion. The container suggestion
	 * only acts as a place-holder to pass along the information to update the matching container definition(s) held by the
	 * container initializer. In particular, it is not expected to store the container suggestion as is, but rather adjust
	 * the actual container definition based on suggested changes.
	 * <p>
	 * IMPORTANT: In reaction to receiving an update request, a container initializer will update the corresponding
	 * container definition (after reconciling changes) at its earliest convenience, using
	 * {@link JavaCore#setClasspathContainer(IPath, IJavaProject[], IClasspathContainer[], IProgressMonitor)}.
	 * Until it does so, the update will not be reflected in the Java Model.
	 * <p>
	 * In order to anticipate whether the container initializer allows to update its containers, the predicate
	 * {@link #canUpdateClasspathContainer(IPath, IJavaProject)} should be used.
	 * <p>
	 * @param containerPath the path of the container which requires to be updated
     * @param project the project for which the container is to be updated
	 * @param containerSuggestion a suggestion to update the corresponding container definition
	 * @throws CoreException when <code>JavaCore#setClasspathContainer</code> would throw any.
	 * @see JavaCore#setClasspathContainer(IPath, IJavaProject[], IClasspathContainer[], org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor)
