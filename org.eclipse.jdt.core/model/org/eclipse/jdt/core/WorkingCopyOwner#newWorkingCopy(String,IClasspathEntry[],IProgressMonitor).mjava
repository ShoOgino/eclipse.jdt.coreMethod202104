	/**
	 * Returns a new working copy with the given name using this working copy owner to
	 * create its buffer.
	 * <p>
	 * This working copy always belongs to the default package in a package
	 * fragment root that corresponds to its Java project, and this Java project never exists.
	 * However this Java project has the given classpath that is used when resolving names
	 * in this working copy.
	 * </p><p>
	 * If a DOM AST is created using this working copy, then given classpath will be used
	 *  if bindings need to be resolved. Problems will be reported to the problem requestor
	 * of the current working copy owner problem if it is not <code>null</code>.
	 * <p></p>
	 * Options used to create the DOM AST are got from {@link JavaCore#getOptions()}
	 * as it is not possible to set the options on a non-existing Java project.
	 * </p><p>
	 * When the working copy instance is created, an {@link IJavaElementDelta#ADDED added delta} is
	 * reported on this working copy.
	 * </p><p>
	 * Once done with the working copy, users of this method must discard it using
	 * {@link ICompilationUnit#discardWorkingCopy()}.
	 * </p><p>
	 * Note that when such working copy is committed, only its buffer is saved (see
	 * {@link IBuffer#save(IProgressMonitor, boolean)}) but no resource is created.
	 * </p><p>
	 * This method is not intended to be overriden by clients.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param name the name of the working copy (e.g. "X.java")
	 * @param classpath the classpath used to resolve names in this working copy
	 * @param monitor a progress monitor used to report progress while opening the working copy
	 * 	or <code>null</code> if no progress should be reported
	 * @throws JavaModelException if the contents of this working copy can
	 *   not be determined.
	 * @return a new working copy
	 * @see ICompilationUnit#becomeWorkingCopy(IProgressMonitor)
	 *
	 * @since 3.3
