/**
 * Creates a new detailed FIELD document fragment on the given range of the document.
 *
 * @param document - the document containing this node's original contents
 * @param sourceRange - a two element array of integers describing the
 *		entire inclusive source range of this node within its document.
 * 		Contents start on and include the character at the first position.
 *		Contents end on and include the character at the last position.
 *		An array of -1's indicates this node's contents do not exist
 *		in the document.
 * @param name - the identifier portion of the name of this field,
 * 		corresponding to VariableDeclaratorId (JLS 8.3).
 * @param nameRange - a two element array of integers describing the
 *		entire inclusive source range of this node's name within its document,
 *		including any array qualifiers that might follow the name.
 * @param commentRange - a two element array describing the comments that precede
 *		the member declaration. The first matches the start of this node's
 *		sourceRange, and the second is the new-line or first non-whitespace
 *		character following the last comment. If no comments are present,
 *		this array contains two -1's.
 * @param flags - an integer representing the modifiers for this member. The
 *		integer can be analyzed with org.eclipse.jdt.core.Flags
 * @param modifierRange - a two element array describing the location of
 *		modifiers for this member within its source range. The first integer
 *		is the first character of the first modifier for this member, and
 *		the second integer is the last whitespace character preceeding the
 *		next part of this member declaration. If there are no modifiers present
 *		in this node's source code (that is, package default visibility), this array
 *		contains two -1's.
 * @param typeRange - a two element array describing the location of the
 *		typeName in the document - the positions of the first and last characters
 *		of the typeName.
 * @param type - the type of the field, in normalized form, as defined in
 *      Type in Field Declaration (JLS 8.3)
 * @param hasInitializer - true if this field declaration includes an initializer,
 *		otherwise false
 * @param initRange - a two element array describing the location of the initializer
 *		in the declaration. The first integer is the position of the character
 *		following the equals sign, and the position of the last character is the last
 *		in the initializer. If this field has no initializer, this array contains
 *		two -1's.
 * @param isVariableDeclarator - true if the field is a seconday variable declarator
 * 		for a previous field declaration.
