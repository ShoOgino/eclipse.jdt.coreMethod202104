/**
 * Creates a new detailed METHOD document fragment on the given range of the document.
 *
 * @param document - the document containing this node's original contents
 * @param sourceRange - a two element array of integers describing the
 *		entire inclusive source range of this node within its document.
 * 		Contents start on and include the character at the first position.
 *		Contents end on and include the character at the last position.
 *		An array of -1's indicates this node's contents do not exist
 *		in the document.
 * @param name - the identifier portion of the name of this node, or
 *		<code>null</code> if this node does not have a name
 * @param nameRange - a two element array of integers describing the
 *		entire inclusive source range of this node's name within its document,
 *		including any array qualifiers that might immediately follow the name
 *		or -1's if this node does not have a name.
 * @param commentRange - a two element array describing the comments that precede
 *		the member declaration. The first matches the start of this node's
 *		sourceRange, and the second is the new-line or first non-whitespace
 *		character following the last comment. If no comments are present,
 *		this array contains two -1's.
 * @param flags - an integer representing the modifiers for this member. The
 *		integer can be analyzed with org.eclipse.jdt.core.Flags
 * @param modifierRange - a two element array describing the location of
 *		modifiers for this member within its source range. The first integer
 *		is the first character of the first modifier for this member, and
 *		the second integer is the last whitespace character preceeding the
 *		next part of this member declaration. If there are no modifiers present
 *		in this node's source code (that is, package default visibility), this array
 *		contains two -1's.
 * @param isConstructor - true if the method is a contructor, otherwise false
 * @param returnType - the normalized return type of this method
 * @param returnTypeRange - a two element array describing the location of the
 *		return type within the method's source range. The first integer is is
 *		the position of the first character in the return type, and the second
 *		integer is the position of the last character in the return type.
 *		For constructors, the contents of this array are -1's.
 * 		If the return type of this method is qualified with '[]' following the
 *		parameter list, this array has four entries. In this case, the last
 *		two entries of the array are the inclusive source range of the array
 *		qualifiers.
 * @param parameterTypes - an array of parameter types in the method declaration
 * 		or <code>null</code> if the method has no parameters
 * @param parameterNames - an array of parameter names in the method declaration
 * 		or <code>null</code> if the method has no parameters
 * @param parameterRange - a two element array describing the location of the
 * 		parameter list in the method. The first integer is the location of the
 *		open parenthesis and the second integer is the location of the closing
 *		parenthesis.
 * @param exceptions - an array of the names of exceptions thrown by this method
 *		or <code>null</code> if the method throws no exceptions
 * @param exceptionRange - a two element array describing the location of the
 * 		exception list in the method declaration. The first integer is the position
 * 		of the first character in the first exception the method throws, and the
 *		second integer is the position of the last character of the last exception
 *		this method throws.
 * @param bodyRange - a two element array describing the location of the method's body.
 *		The first integer is the first character following the method's
 *		parameter list, or exception list (if present). The second integer is the location
 * 		of the last character in the method's source range.
