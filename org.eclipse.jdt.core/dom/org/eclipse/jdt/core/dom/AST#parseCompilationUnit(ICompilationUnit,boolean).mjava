	/**
	 * Parses the source string of the given Java model compilation unit element
	 * and creates and returns a corresponding abstract syntax tree. The source
	 * string is obtained from the Java model element using
	 * <code>ICompilationUnit.getSource()</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * The returned compilation unit node is the root node of a new AST.
	 * Each node in the subtree carries source range(s) information relating back
	 * to positions in the source string (the source string is not remembered
	 * with the AST).
	 * The source range usually begins at the first character of the first token
	 * corresponding to the node; leading whitespace and comments are <b>not</b>
	 * included. The source range usually extends through the last character of
	 * the last token corresponding to the node; trailing whitespace and
	 * comments are <b>not</b> included. There are a handful of exceptions
	 * (including compilation units and the various body declarations); the
	 * specification for these node type spells out the details.
	 * Source ranges nest properly: the source range for a child is always
	 * within the source range of its parent, and the source ranges of sibling
	 * nodes never overlap.
	 * If a syntax error is detected while parsing, the relevant node(s) of the
	 * tree will be flagged as <code>MALFORMED</code>.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If <code>resolveBindings</code> is <code>true</code>, the various names
	 * and types appearing in the compilation unit can be resolved to "bindings"
	 * by calling the <code>resolveBinding</code> methods. These bindings
	 * draw connections between the different parts of a program, and
	 * generally afford a more powerful vantage point for clients who wish to
	 * analyze a program's structure more deeply. These bindings come at a
	 * considerable cost in both time and space, however, and should not be
	 * requested frivolously. The additional space is not reclaimed until the
	 * AST, all its nodes, and all its bindings become garbage. So it is very
	 * important to not retain any of these objects longer than absolutely
	 * necessary. Bindings are resolved at the time the AST is created. Subsequent
	 * modifications to the AST do not affect the bindings returned by
	 * <code>resolveBinding</code> methods in any way; these methods return the
	 * same binding as before the AST was modified (including modifications
	 * that rearrange subtrees by reparenting nodes).
	 * If <code>resolveBindings</code> is <code>false</code>, the analysis
	 * does not go beyond parsing and building the tree, and all
	 * <code>resolveBinding</code> methods return <code>null</code> from the
	 * outset.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param unit the Java model compilation unit whose source code is to be parsed
	 * @param resolveBindings <code>true</code> if bindings are wanted,
	 *   and <code>false</code> if bindings are not of interest
	 * @return the compilation unit node
	 * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the given Java element does not
	 * exist or if its source string cannot be obtained
