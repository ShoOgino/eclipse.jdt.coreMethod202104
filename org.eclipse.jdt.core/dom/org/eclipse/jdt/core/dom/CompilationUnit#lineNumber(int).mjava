	/**
	 * Returns the line number corresponding to the given source character
	 * position in the original source string. The initial line of the 
	 * compilation unit is numbered 1, and each line extends through the
	 * last character of the end-of-line delimiter. The very last line extends
	 * through the end of the source string and has no line delimiter.
	 * For example, the source string <code>class A\n{\n}</code> has 3 lines
	 * corresponding to inclusive character ranges [0,7], [8,9], and [10,10].
	 * Returns 1 for a character position that does not correspond to any
	 * source line, or if no line number information is available for this
	 * compilation unit.
	 * 
	 * @param position a 0-based character position, possibly
	 *   negative or out of range
	 * @return the 1-based line number, or <code>1</code> if the character
	 *    position does not correspond to a source line in the original
	 *    source file or if line number information is not known for this
	 *    compilation unit
	 * @deprecated Use getLineNumber(int) instead.
	 * @see ASTParser
