	/**
	 * Returns the key for this binding.
	 * <p>
	 * Within a connected cluster of bindings (for example, all bindings 
	 * reachable from a given AST), each binding will have a distinct keys.
	 * The keys are generated in a manner that is predictable and as
	 * stable as possible. This last property makes these keys useful for 
	 * comparing bindings between disconnected clusters of bindings (for example, 
	 * the bindings between the "before" and "after" ASTs of the same
	 * compilation unit).
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The exact details of how the keys are generated is unspecified.
	 * However, it is a function of the following information:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>packages - the name of the package (for an unnamed package,
	 *   some internal id)</li>
	 * <li>classes or interfaces - the VM name of the type and the key
	 *   of its package</li>
	 * <li>array types - the key of the component type and number of
	 *   dimensions</li>
	 * <li>primitive types - the name of the primitive type</li>
	 * <li>fields - the name of the field and the key of its declaring
	 *   type</li>
	 * <li>methods - the name of the method, the key of its declaring
	 *   type, and the keys of the parameter types</li>
	 * <li>constructors - the key of its declaring class, and the 
	 *   keys of the parameter types</li>
	 * <li>local variables - the name of the local variable, the index of the 
	 *   declaring block relative to its parent, the key of its method</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * Some bindings, like ones that correspond to declarations occurring
	 * within the body of a method, are problematic because of the lack of
	 * any universally acceptable way of assigning keys that are both
	 * predictable and stable. The keys for bindings to local types, etc. 
	 * is unspecified, and may be <code>null</code>.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @return the key for this binding, or <code>null</code> if none
