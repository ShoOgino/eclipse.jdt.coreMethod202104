	 * <p>
	 * A leading comment is a comment that appears before the statement.
	 * It may be either a traditional comment or an end-of-line comment.
	 * Traditional comments must begin with "/&#42;, may contain line breaks,
	 * and must end with "&#42;/. End-of-line comments must begin with "//",
	 * must end with a line delimiter (as per JLS 3.7), and must not contain
	 * line breaks.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @return the comment string, or <code>null</code> if none
	 * @deprecated This feature was removed in the 2.1 release because it was
	 * only a partial, and inadequate, solution to the issue of associating
	 * comments with statements. Furthermore, AST.parseCompilationUnit did not
	 * associate leading comments, making this moot. Clients that need to access
	 * comments preceding a statement should either consult the compilation
	 * unit's {@linkplain CompilationUnit#getCommentList() comment table}
	 * or use a scanner to reanalyze the source text immediately preceding
	 * the statement's source range.
