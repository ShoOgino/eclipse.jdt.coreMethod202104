	 * Adds a new static import to the rewriter's record and returns a reference that can be used in the code. The reference will

	 * existing.
	 * 	<p>
 	 * No imports are added for members that are already known. If a import for a type is recorded to be removed, this record is discarded instead.
	 * </p>

	 * The content of the compilation unit itself is actually not modified
	 * in any way by this method; rather, the rewriter just records that a new import has been added.
	 * </p>
	 * @param binding The binding of the static field or method to be added.
	 * @return returns either the simple member name if the import was successful or else the qualified name if
	 * an import conflict prevented the import.
	 * @throws IllegalArgumentException an {@link IllegalArgumentException} is thrown if the binding is not a static field
	 * or method.
