	 * Defaults to none (<code>null</code>).</p>
	 * <p>
	 * The name of the compilation unit must be supplied for resolving bindings.
	 * This name should be suffixed by a dot ('.') followed by one of the

	 * and match the name of the main (public) class or interface declared in the source.</p>

	 * <p>This name must represent the full path of the unit inside the given project. For example, if the source
	 * declares a public class named "Foo" in a project "P" where the source folder is the project itself, the name
	 * of the compilation unit must be "/P/Foo.java".
	 * If the source declares a public class name "Bar" in a package "p1.p2" in a project "P" in a source folder "src",
	 * the name of the compilation unit must be "/P/src/p1/p2/Bar.java".</p>
