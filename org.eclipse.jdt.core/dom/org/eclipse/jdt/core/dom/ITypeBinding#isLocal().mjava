	/**
	 * Returns whether this type binding represents a local class.
	 * <p>
	 * A local class is any nested class or enum type not declared as a member
	 * of another class or interface. A local class is a subspecies of nested
	 * type, and mutually exclusive with member types. For anonymous
	 * classes, which are considered a subspecies of local classes, this method
	 * returns true.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note: This deviates from JLS3 14.3, which states that anonymous types are
	 * not local types since they do not have a name. Also note that interfaces
	 * and annotation types cannot be local.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @return <code>true</code> if this type binding is for a local class or
	 * enum type, and <code>false</code> otherwise
