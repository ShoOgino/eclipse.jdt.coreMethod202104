	/**
	 * Returns a Java search scope limited to the hierarchy of the given type and to a given project.
	 * The Java elements resulting from a search with this scope will be types in this hierarchy.
	 * <p>
	 * Unlike the <code>createHierarchyScope</code> methods, this method creates <em>strict</em>
	 * scopes that only contain types that actually span the hierarchy of the focus
	 * type, but do not include additional enclosing or member types.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * By default, hierarchy scopes include all direct and indirect supertypes and subtypes of the
	 * focus type. This method, however, allows to restrict the hierarchy to true subtypes,
	 * and exclude supertypes. Also, inclusion of the focus type itself is controlled by a parameter.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param project the project to which to constrain the search, or <code>null</code> if
	 *        search should consider all types in the workspace
	 * @param type the focus of the hierarchy scope
	 * @param onlySubtypes if <code>true</code> only subtypes of <code>type</code> are considered
	 * @param includeFocusType if true the focus type <code>type</code> is included in the resulting scope,
	 * 		  otherwise it is excluded
	 * @param owner the owner of working copies that take precedence over original compilation units,
	 *        or <code>null</code> if the primary working copy owner should be used
	 * @return a new hierarchy scope
	 * @exception JavaModelException if the hierarchy could not be computed on the given type
	 * @since 3.6
