	/**
	 * Answer a new compiler using the given name environment and compiler options.
	 * The environment and options will be in effect for the lifetime of the compiler.
	 * When the compiler is run, compilation results are sent to the given requestor.
	 *
	 *  @param environment org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.api.env.INameEnvironment
	 *      Environment used by the compiler in order to resolve type and package
	 *      names. The name environment implements the actual connection of the compiler
	 *      to the outside world (e.g. in batch mode the name environment is performing
	 *      pure file accesses, reuse previous build state or connection to repositories).
	 *      Note: the name environment is responsible for implementing the actual classpath
	 *            rules.
	 *
	 *  @param policy org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.api.problem.IErrorHandlingPolicy
	 *      Configurable part for problem handling, allowing the compiler client to
	 *      specify the rules for handling problems (stop on first error or accumulate
	 *      them all) and at the same time perform some actions such as opening a dialog
	 *      in UI when compiling interactively.
	 *      @see org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.DefaultErrorHandlingPolicies
	 *      
	 *  @param requestor org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.api.ICompilerRequestor
	 *      Component which will receive and persist all compilation results and is intended
	 *      to consume them as they are produced. Typically, in a batch compiler, it is 
	 *      responsible for writing out the actual .class files to the file system.
	 *      @see org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.CompilationResult
	 *
	 *  @param problemFactory org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.api.problem.IProblemFactory
	 *      Factory used inside the compiler to create problem descriptors. It allows the
	 *      compiler client to supply its own representation of compilation problems in
	 *      order to avoid object conversions. Note that the factory is not supposed
	 *      to accumulate the created problems, the compiler will gather them all and hand
	 *      them back as part of the compilation unit result.
	 *      
	 *  @deprecated this constructor is keeped to preserve 3.1 and 3.2M4 compatibility
