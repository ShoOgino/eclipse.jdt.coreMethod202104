	 * except that this method throw NumberFormatException in
	 * the case of overflow to infinity or underflow to 0.
	 * The method handles all the tricky cases, including 
	 * fraction rounding to 53 bits and gradual underflow.

	 * hexadecimal floating-point literal
	 * @return the double value, including Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY
