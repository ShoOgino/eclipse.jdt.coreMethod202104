/**
 * This method is responsible for adding a <clinit> method declaration to the type method collections.
 * Note that this implementation is inserting it in first place (as VAJ or javac), and that this
 * impacts the behavior of the method ConstantPool.resetForClinit(int. int), in so far as 
 * the latter will have to reset the constant pool state accordingly (if it was added first, it does 
 * not need to preserve some of the method specific cached entries since this will be the first method).
 * inserts the clinit method declaration in the first position.
 * 
 * @see org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.codegen.ConstantPool#resetForClinit(int, int)
