	/**
	 * Return the elements which are visible from the completion location and which can be assigned to the given type.
	 * An element is assignable if its type can be assigned to a variable
	 * of the given type, as specified in section 5.2 of <em>The Java Language
	 * Specification, Third Edition</em> (JLS3).
	 * A visible element is either:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>a {@link ILocalVariable} - the element type is {@link ILocalVariable#getTypeSignature()}</li>
	 * <li>a {@link IField} - the element type is {@link IField#getTypeSignature()}</li>
	 * <li>a {@link IMethod} - the element type is {@link IMethod#getReturnType()}</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * Returned elements defined in the completed compilation unit are special Java elements:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>they are based on the current content of the compilation unit's buffer, they are not the result of a reconcile operation</li>
	 * <li>they are not updated if the buffer changes.</li>
	 * <li>they do not contain local types which are not visible from the completion location.</li>
	 * <li>they do not give information about categories. {@link IMember#getCategories()} will return an empty array</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * Note the array can be empty if:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>the compilation unit no longer exists</li>
	 * <li>the completion occurred in a binary type. However this restriction might be relaxed in the future.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * @param typeSignature elements which can be assigned to this type are returned.
	 * 		If <code>null</code> there is no constraint on the type of the returned elements.
	 *
	 * @return elements which are visible from the completion location and which can be assigned to the given type.
	 *
	 * @exception UnsupportedOperationException if the context is not an extended context
	 *
	 * @see #isExtended()
	 *
	 * @since 3.4
