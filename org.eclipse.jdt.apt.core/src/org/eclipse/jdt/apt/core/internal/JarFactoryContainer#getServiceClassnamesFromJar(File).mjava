     * Given a jar file, get the names of any AnnotationProcessorFactory

     * <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jar/jar.html#Service%20Provider">
     * Jar Service Provider spec</a>: the jar file contains a META-INF/services
     * directory; that directory contains text files named according to the desired
     * interfaces; and each file contains the names of the classes implementing
     * the specified service.  The files may also contain whitespace (which is to
     * be ignored).  The '#' character indicates the beginning of a line comment,
     * also to be ignored.  Implied but not stated in the spec is that this routine
     * also ignores anything after the first nonwhitespace token on a line.
     * @param jar the jar file.
     * @return a list, possibly empty, of fully qualified classnames to be instantiated.
