	/**
	 * Write <code>contents</code> to disk in the form of a compilation unit named
	 * <code>name</code> under package fragment <code>pkgFrag</code>. The way in
	 * which the write is done depends whether the compilation unit is a working copy.
	 * <p>
	 * The working copy is used in reconcile. In principle changing the contents during
	 * build should be a problem, since the Java builder is based on file contents rather
	 * than on the current Java Model. However, annotation processors get their type info
	 * from the Java Model even during build, so there is in general no difference between
	 * build and reconcile. This causes certain bugs (if a build is performed while there
	 * is unsaved content in editors), so it may change in the future, and this routine
	 * will need to be fixed. - WHarley 11/06
	 * <p>
	 * This method touches the disk and modifies working copies. It can only be called
	 * during build, not during reconcile, and it should not be called while holding any
	 * locks (other than the workspace rules held by the build).
	 * 
	 * @param pkgFrag
	 *            the package fragment in which the type will be created. The fragment's
	 *            folders must already exist on disk.
	 * @param cuName
	 *            the simple name of the type, with extension, such as 'Obj.java'
	 * @param contents
	 *            the text of the compilation unit
	 * @param progressMonitor
