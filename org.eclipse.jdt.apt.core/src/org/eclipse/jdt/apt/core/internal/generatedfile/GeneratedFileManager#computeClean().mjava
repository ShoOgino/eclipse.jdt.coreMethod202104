	 * Make the map updates necessary to discard build state. Typically called while
	 * processing a clean. In addition to throwing away the build dependencies, we also
	 * throw away all the blank working copies used to hide existing generated files, on
	 * the premise that since they were deleted in the clean we don't need to hide them
	 * any more.  We leave the rest of the reconcile-time dependency info, though.
	 * <p>
	 * This method is atomic with regard to data structure integrity.  This method
	 * does not touch disk nor create, discard, or modify compilation units.
	 * 
	 * @return a list of working copies that the caller must discard by calling
	 *         {@link CompilationUnitHelper#discardWorkingCopy(ICompilationUnit)}.
